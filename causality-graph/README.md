# Hetu Causality Graph

A decentralized causality graph system that provides distributed digital knowledge graph capabilities.

## Core Features

### 1. DGraph (Decentralized Digital Graph)
- Decentralized knowledge graph system
- Enables distributed storage and management of graph data
- Automatic data backup and synchronization
- Built on Dgraph for distributed database capabilities

### 2. P2P Network
- Distributed peer-to-peer network communication
- Ensures reliable and efficient data transmission between nodes
- Relay node architecture with master-slave replication
- Secure data transmission with TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)

### 3. POCW (Proof of Causality Work)
- Novel consensus mechanism for causality verification
- Maintains data integrity and trust in the network
- Lamport ID-based identity system
- Causal consistency enforcement

### 4. Causality Dashboard
- Web-based visualization interface
- Browse and interact with the causality graph
- Monitor network status and analytics
- User identity management and verification
